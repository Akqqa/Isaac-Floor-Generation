TODO based on reddit feedback:
Rock placements - try to maybe follow likelihood of real room probabilities? - would also fix issue of not having super rare spawns where rocks block most places
Chest and Dark room cant have rooms directly above spawn! hard code that in.
Make scorch marks easier to see on dark backgrounds? 
LABYRINTH CAN HAVE (RARE) ROOMS NEXT TO EACH OTHER
labyrinth should have 2 boss rooms whoops
weird bug with games played: 13 - ask more abt that

SO MAIN GOALS FOR NEXT UPDATE:
accurate rock placements and do them before adding the secret rooms (will always be space for secret)
after this, ultra secret is easy
