TODO based on reddit feedback:
Rock placements - cant appear in shops, sac rooms, challenge rooms etc. Quick fix should be fine but make sure to increase rock probability slightly to balance it out
Chest and Dark room cant have rooms directly above spawn! hard code that in.
Make scorch marks easier to see on dark backgrounds?
