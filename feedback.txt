TODO based on reddit feedback:
Rock placements - try to maybe follow likelihood of real room probabilities? - would also fix issue of not having super rare spawns where rocks block most places
Make scorch marks easier to see on dark backgrounds? 
LABYRINTH CAN HAVE (RARE) ROOMS NEXT TO EACH OTHER
see how red rooms also showing usr works with balance?
^ MAKES IT MORE CONSISTENT, BUT ALSO POSSIBLE TO ACCIDENTALLY STUMBLE UPON A RED ROOMS
    I THINK IT FEELS BETTER, BUT THE RANDOM WINS TAKE AWAY FROM THE SKILL ELEMENT
    IDEALLY, WOULD HAVE A SEPARATE INPUT TO UNLOCK RED ROOMS. HM. WOULD JUST COMPLICATE IT TOO MUCH AND MAKE IT TOO OBTUSE WITH A PROPERTUTORIAL NEEDED, PLAYER CONFUSION etc
    JUST LEAVE AS IS FOR NOW. AS OVERWHELMING PLAYER FEEDBACK ASKED FOR IT, THEN IN A WEEK OR TWO RUN A POLL. SIMPLE. ITS OK IF ITS IMPERFECT RN
    can make an options section and add "assist mode" for red rooms and "precision mode" for not
large rooms (probably never)
potentially add a seed option to endless, + more customisation
BUG - at some point, the localstorage makes it so that the red key isnt activated if its saved. very weird

CONSIDER changing volume to settings, making an assist mode for the red rooms there too, a tutorial when you activate red key, etc.
or not, depending on the poll
ITS NOT THAT DEEP

POTENTIAL EASY ADJUSTMENT - if the player guesses the exact spot, the get a special emoji next to ultra secret room, or (exact) or something. this incentivises perfection!

poll options:
leave as is
leave as is but reduce bombs as more spaces to get right
revert back to precision
add a setting to switch between the modes
add a "perfect" to the win message, so players who pick the exact position are rewarded
do it next sat
after the win message. 



Bugs:
can place bombs while loading oops
RED KEY NOT SAVING - IT IS IN LOCALSTORAGE BUT NOT APPLYING CORRECTLY?
delerium invalid spawns
NEW BUG - when new day while on page, the generated map had the same layout, but the rooms were different incl secret room placement. must be some issue with the seed after the initial gen?
unsure. thought it was a browser thing but working fine in private tabs after
cant replicate it manually. which makes it scarier
