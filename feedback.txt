TODO based on reddit feedback:
Rock placements - try to maybe follow likelihood of real room probabilities? - would also fix issue of not having super rare spawns where rocks block most places
Make scorch marks easier to see on dark backgrounds? 
LABYRINTH CAN HAVE (RARE) ROOMS NEXT TO EACH OTHER

Bugs:
can place bombs while loading oops


PLAN:
implement ultra secrets, make post aout it. if you feel like you need to in the future, then rework the gameplay to be a run. simple. also post to hutts server
WAIT - YOU CAN LITERALLY JUST ADD THE DAILY RUN AS A THIRD MODE LOL THATS LITERALLY, FINE. make a MAIN MENU!!!! three options - daily floor, daily run, and endless!
consider updating the rock stuff, or just the odds so that can spawn in 2 room more likely even if three (actually dont its not fun or fair)
so. first add ultra secret and a main menu. and a timer?
then add daily run page. 
timer complicates ultra secret design. um. main menu isnt rly an option considering 2 different pages will have diff stats, and would have to be different maps or theyd both be playable
i think just maybe, button on page. doesnt reset timer? but is remembered. timing isnt a big deal,
