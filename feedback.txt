TODO based on reddit feedback:
Rock placements - try to maybe follow likelihood of real room probabilities? - would also fix issue of not having super rare spawns where rocks block most places
Make scorch marks easier to see on dark backgrounds? 
LABYRINTH CAN HAVE (RARE) ROOMS NEXT TO EACH OTHER

SO MAIN GOALS FOR NEXT UPDATE:
accurate rock placements and do them before adding the secret rooms (will always be space for secret)
after this, ultra secret is easy ( can add this before rock changes at it should always be done last anyway )
ultra secret will be an optional hard mode toggle - only togglable if before any other changes on a day
honestly maybe deprioritise the rock placements. its fun enough with them as they are - too accurate and itd become less of a fair game! still adheres to the rules so good for learning, just doesnt give bs scenarios often.
^ mayeb just leave them as they are, try putting rock spawning before secret room placement, then see if that feels too unfair. if so can tweak - thats what the dev branch is for!

add a number to the secret roomle copy paste - note that sat 26th april was day 1

weird potential bug not allowing players to plcae bombs in certain spots? may just be device issue
music doesnt loop lol


maybe one day fix the landscape being too small on iphones. maybe. one day. its so insignificant and its so much work to get it done. phones are really inconsistent
